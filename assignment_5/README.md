#### Problem Set 5 for Matched Filters

`problem_1.ipynb` is the main file where the majority of the analysis takes place. It makes use of other files such as:
* *read_ligo.ipynb*, to extract the data
* *snr.py* to do signal to noise ratio calculations and plots
* *noise.py* to get the noise model and whiten the data
* *waves.py* to plot the noise model and matched filters

I saved the generated figures for parts a) to d). They are also shown in the main file.
* noise_models.png
* matched_filters_plot.png
* signal_to_noise_ratio_plots.png
* analytic_signal_to_noise_ratio.png

The printed results for parts e) and f) are found in `problem_1.ipynb`.
